# types of strings

t = b'abc'  # bytes string - default for python 2. Each character is 1 byte. Can't be used for non-ASCII characters (Chinese, Hebrew, emojis, etc)

q = r'\a\bc'  # raw string - doesn't interpret special characters such as backslash. They are used literally, ie exactly as typed.


print('Three string types, unicode, bytes, raw', s, t, q)


# Bytes are often used in serial communications over RS232 or Bluetooth.

# One byte = 8 bits. One bit is either a 0 or a 1

# Serial means one bit after the other like a single queue.

# Parallel means side by side like many queues

# HARDWARE HISTORY

# In the early days parallel was much faster than serial because many bits

# were transferred at each clock cycle. As faster clock cycles were used it

# became impossible to ensure all bits travelling down a parallel cable arrived

# at the same time so serial has now overtaken parallel.

# Parallel printer cables have been replaced with USB (Universal Serial Bus)

# PATA hard drive cables have been replaced with SATA (Serial ATA)

# Operators

# + is addition

# - is subtraction

# * is multiplication

# / is division with remainder - even when using integers it will return a float

# // is floor division, will only give the answer to the whole number - always returns an int,rounded down

# %  is the modulo which will give the remainder of an operation

# ** power - note that the carrot ^ is not used for powers in python as it will just add the numbers

# &  (ampersand) bitwise and - binery

# |  (pipe) bitwise or - binery excluse one or the other but not both
